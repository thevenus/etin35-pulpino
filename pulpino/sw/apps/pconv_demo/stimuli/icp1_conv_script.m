%% Instructions
% --------------------------------------------- %
% - Use this script to generate the input data and weights to be sent to
% the convolution unit.
% - Change "w_rows" and "w_cols" depending on whether you are working with
% 3x3 or 5x5 convolution.
% - Use a padding such as the number of rows/columns of the ofm is the same
% as the number of rows/columns of the ifm.
% - In HW, all numbers should be represented as positive 8 bits fixed-point
% format, meaning that the range is between 0 and 255, if any ofm value
% goes beyond this range, it must saturate (e.g. 278 -> 255).
%
%
%
% - Use this script as a tool for comparing your simulation results with
% the results obtained in this script. Currently the script generates
% random inputs and weights, you should be able to store the randommly
% generated inputs and weights into a .txt so that you can stimuli your
% design with such data, and so that you can load such data to this script
% later again, rather than generating new random data, for results
% comparison.

% Define the size of the ifm and weights kernel
ifm_rows = 28; % Do not change
ifm_cols = 28; % Do not change
ifm_channels = 3; % Do not change

w_rows = 5;
w_cols = 5;
ofm_channels = 1; % Do not change

% Define padding to be added to input
padding = 2;

% Define stride of the convolution operation (keep to 1)
stride = 1; % Do not change

% Padding and stride determine 2D dimensions of output feature map
ofm_rows = 2*padding + ifm_rows - (w_rows - 1)*stride;
ofm_cols = 2*padding + ifm_cols - (w_cols - 1)*stride;

% Generate ifm (weights) randomdly with integers between 0 and 3 (5 for weights)
ifm = randi([0, 3], ifm_rows, ifm_cols, ifm_channels);
w = randi([0, 5], w_rows, w_cols, ifm_channels, ofm_channels);

ofm = zeros(ofm_rows, ofm_cols, ofm_channels);
for i = 1:ofm_channels
    ofm(:,:,i) = convolution(ifm, w(:,:,:,i), stride, padding);
end

%% Plot
% Before saturation
figure()
histogram(ofm);
figure()
imagesc(ofm);

% After saturation
ofm = min(ofm, 255);
figure()
histogram(ofm);
figure()
imagesc(ofm);
